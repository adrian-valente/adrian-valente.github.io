Hi!

I'm Adrian Valente, and I am currently a PhD student in computational neuroscience, working at ENS Paris, under the direction of Srdjan Ostojic.

Together with [Alexis Dubreuil](http://alexisdubreuil.fr/), I am currently focusing on reverse-engineering recurrent neural networks trained to accomplish cognitive tasks, using tools from dynamical systems theory and statistical physics. 

Before doing neuroscience, I studied mathematics and computer science. I am an enthusiast programmer and lover of open source, and also passionate about questions of theoretical computer science and cryptography.

Hope to see you around!
