Welcome to my website! 

I'm Adrian Valente, currently Research Engineer at [Instadeep](https://instadeep.com/) in Paris, developing LLMs for genomic data. Previously, I was a PhD student in computational neuroscience, working under the direction of [Srdjan Ostojic](https://twitter.com/ostojic_srdjan) at ENS Paris, where I worked on explaining the dynamics of recurrent neural networks using low-rank approximations, and on applications to electrophysiological (notably prefrontal cortex) data. You can find my thesis [here]({{site.url}}/assets/pdfs/thesis_full.pdf), as well as the list of publications [here](cv.md). I also worked at Centre Léon Bérard in Lyon with Stéphane Depil on models of epitope presentation for cancer immunotherapies, and at Microsoft in software engineering.

Here, I like to talk about neural networks (artificial and biological), and ML and software engineering for science.

## Featured projects and posts
- [Low-rank RNNs]({{site.url}}/2022/06/01/low-rank-summary.html): a summary of my PhD work on low-rank RNNs and their applications to interpretability of neural dynamics.
- [RNNs strike back]({{site.url}}/2023/10/03/linear-rnns.html): a post covering the field of linear RNNs, also known as state-space models, and how they came back in the race for SOTA sequence modelling when we thought Transformers had killed them.
- [Software engineering for scientists](https://avalente.quarto.pub/sweforscientists/): a WIP of 2025, this is a book I am writing to help scientists master the best practices of software engineering, like version control, testing, CI/CD, containerization and many more.
- [hippoLLM](https://github.com/adrian-valente/hippollm): a project from 2024 exploring the use of hybrid graph-vector databases as long-term memory modules for LLMs.
