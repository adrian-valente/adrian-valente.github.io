Welcome to my website! 

I'm Adrian Valente, currently Research Engineer at [Instadeep](https://instadeep.com/) in Paris, developing LLMs for genomic data. Previously, I was a PhD student in computational neuroscience, working under the direction of [Srdjan Ostojic](https://twitter.com/ostojic_srdjan) at ENS Paris, where I worked on explaining the dynamics of recurrent neural networks using low-rank approximations, and on applications to electrophysiological (notably prefrontal cortex) data. You can find my thesis [here]({{site.url}}/assets/pdfs/thesis_full.pdf), as well as the list of publications [here](cv.md). I also worked at Centre Léon Bérard in Lyon with Stéphane Depil on models of epitope presentation for cancer immunotherapies, and at Microsoft in software engineering.
