Welcome to my website! 

I'm Adrian Valente, French PhD student in computational neuroscience, working under the direction of [Srdjan Ostojic](https://twitter.com/ostojic_srdjan) at ENS Paris. I came to this field with a background in mathematics and computer science which left me with a compulsive obsession for excessive formalism. 

I finally made this website, partly to claim possession of my little island on the internet, but mostly because I take a lot of notes during my procrastinative endeavours and wanted to share the most presentable of them.

Hope you enjoy it here, and hope to see you around some day, maybe even outside of zoom, or in a simulation, who knows, the world is full of surprises!
